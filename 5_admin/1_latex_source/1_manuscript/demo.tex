\section{Introduction}
In recent studies, significant progress has been made in the field of computational mechanics. For instance, the application of generic methodologies has been extensively discussed in the literature. The work by \citet{LoremIpsum2015a} presents a foundational approach to computational software development, which has paved the way for more specialized studies. Following this, \citet{LoremIpsum2023a} introduced efficient solutions for handling complex placeholder problems on adaptive grids. Moreover, the research by \citet{LoremIpsum2023b} explores innovative machine learning frameworks for addressing fictitious scenarios, demonstrating the adaptability of modern computational techniques to a broad range of applications.
