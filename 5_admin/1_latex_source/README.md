# Latex source
Here, we will have the latex source files. I highly recommend that you use latex to write your research.  

| Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_manuscript | This folder contains the source files for manuscript.        |
| 2_figures    | All the figures for publications must be made in a vector editing program. This folder should contain all the source files for figures. |
| 3_plots      |I recommend Veusz for 2D plots, as it supports automatic plot updating based on changes in the source data.|
| 10_rebuttal  |This folder contains all the files for the rebuttal.|

Every submission has two destinations:

- **Review:** If the reviewers like your paper, most likely, they will ask for a review. Once you incorporate all the reviews, you must prepare a rebuttal outlining how you have answered their queries. The source files for the rebuttal are provided in the 9_rebuttal folder.
- **Reject:** You must find a different journal to suit your research better and submit it there.
