# Submission
This folder will contain all the submission files.  It is a good practice to keep all the submission files in a separate folder and review them before submitting. 

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_manuscript_file.pdf |This is the main pdf file for your submission. Copy and paste this from the 4_latex_source folder and review it before submitting it to the journal.|
| 2_cover_letter.pdf    | A cover letter for your submission.                          |
| 3_metadata.md         |This file should contain all the supplementary text you need for the submission. See the sample file provided in this repository for details.|

**Note: Multiple other kinds of files are required for submission but may vary as per the selected journal. See the journal's website for more details and include them in this folder.**

## Submission checklist

1. All the figures and tables have a caption with inference.
2. All the figures and tables have been cited in the main text.
3. All the reviewers are cited in the manuscript.
4. The manuscript is spell-checked and grammar-checked.
5. Each highlight is less than 100 characters.

## Review Guidelines

- **Set 1:** This is the most important part of the paper and will help the reviewer make a first impression of your article. It is very important that this set is 100% correct and clearly conveys the central idea of the paper.

  `Highlights` → `Abstract` → `Conclusion` → `Figures, Tables, and Captions` 

- **Set 2:** This is the main content of the paper. If the reviewer is impressed by Set-1, then only they will look into this set during the review.

  `Cross-reference` → `Symbols` → `Main Text`

**Here are general guidelines before you submit your paper to the journal.**

- **Highlights.** These should be less than 100 characters per bullet point and properly convey all the contributions, originality, and values of the paper. If required, you can also add your findings to the highlight, but they are unnecessary.
- **Abstract.** Your abstract must clearly convey the novelties of your paper and highlight the primary contributions in such a manner that is easy to understand for the reviewer.
- **Conclusion.** A reviewer will go directly to the conclusion after the abstract to check whether the article is worth his or her time. Understand that this is your opportunity to bring forward the main motivation and contributions of your work.
- **Figures.** Check whether all figures are clear and properly convey the idea for which they were made.
- **Tables.** Check the table headings and values for any inconsistency.
- **Captions.** Check whether all captions properly summarize the figure and table. Also, check if the inference presented will help the reviewer understand the figure better. You are responsible for making it as easy as possible for the reviewer to understand your work.
- **Cross-reference.** Thoroughly check all the references in the main text. Do they point to their intended entity or not?
- **Symbols.** Check for consistency of symbols. It is a good idea first to list the symbols used and then review the article to see if everything is in order. 
- **Main Text.** Finally, read the main text and thoroughly check it for spelling and grammar mistakes.

Every submission has two destinations:

- **Review:** If the reviewers like your paper, most likely, they will ask for a review. Once you incorporate all the reviews, you must prepare a rebuttal outlining how you have answered their queries. The source files for the rebuttal are provided in the 4_latex_source/9_rebuttal folder.
- **Reject:** You must find a different journal to suit your research better and submit it there.
