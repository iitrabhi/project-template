# Rules
- Folder names should always be in small letters and begin with a number.
- No spaces are allowed in folder or file names. You have to use the underscore "_."
- The folders should be numbered in chronological order, i.e., the folders that come in the initial part of your research should have a smaller number.
- Every folder should have a readme file that should contain a description of the contents of that folder.

# Folder structure

The folders follow a 5-level wide and 3-level deep structure. That means it is preferable to have only five folders at a certain level, and the structuring of the information should be done in such a way that it is only 3-levels deep, starting from the top-level folder. This is necessary for the retrieval of the information at a later day.

| Name                 | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_base_papers        | The papers that form the foundation for your research are kept in this folder.  We start a new project by curating a list of research publications in the area of interest. |
| 2_reference_codes    | The open-source codes relevant to your research that you find on the internet will be kept in this folder. In the field of computational mechanics, we try to find existing code implementations and study them to gain insight into the topic. |
| 3_our_implementation | This folder will have the source code for your research. This is your actual implementation that will lead to novel findings. |
| 4_latex_source       |Here, we will have the latex source files. I highly recommend that you use latex to write your research.|
|5_submission|This folder will contain all the submission files. It is a good practice to keep all the submission files in a separate folder and review them before submitting. |
|6_logs |This folder will contain daily logs for the work that we do in the project|
|7_meetings|All the meetings will be documented in this folder|

**Note: See the readme file inside the folder for more details.**
