# Rules
- Folder names should always be in small letters and begin with a number.
- No spaces are allowed in folder or file names. You have to use the underscore "_."
- The folders should be numbered in chronological order, i.e., those in the initial part of your research should have a smaller number.
- Every folder should have a ReadMe file containing a description of that folder's contents.

# Folder structure

The folders follow a 5-level wide and 3-level deep structure. That means it is preferable to have only five folders at a certain level, and the structuring of the information should be done in such a way that it is only 3-levels deep, starting from the top-level folder. This is necessary for the retrieval of the information at a later day.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1_library | The papers/presentations that form the foundation for your research are kept in this folder.  We start a new project by curating a list of research publications in the area of interest. |
| 2_codes | The open-source codes relevant to your research that you find on the internet will be kept in this folder. We try to find and study existing code implementations in computational mechanics to gain insight. The codes will be developed in the workshop directory, and the final paper problems will be stored in the paper_problem folder. |
| 3_logs | This folder will contain daily logs for the work that we do in the project |
| 4_meetings | All the meetings will be recorded in this folder |
| 5_admin | This folder contains the latex source files as well as other administrative work of the project |

**Note: See the readme file inside the folder for more details.**
